= Communication Between Parts

== Leader Component

**Discord Communication**: The Leader uses `discord4j.core.GatewayDiscordClient` to interact with Discord, including receiving events and sending messages.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== Worker Component

**Discord Communication**: The Worker interacts with Discord through the Connect-middleware.

**Clash Royale API**: The Worker fetches data from the Clash Royale API to respond to user queries.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== Connect-middleware Component

**RSocket Communication**: The Connect-middleware uses RSocket for reactive communication, enabling efficient and scalable interactions between components.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== Examples

=== Example 1: Worker Fetching Data from Clash Royale API

1. User sends a command to Discord.
2. Worker receives the command via Connect-middleware.
3. Worker fetches data from the Clash Royale API.
4. Worker sends the response back to Discord via Connect-middleware.

=== Example 2: Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ

1. Worker sends a message to RabbitMQ.
2. Leader receives the message from RabbitMQ.
3. Leader processes the message and sends a response back to RabbitMQ.
4. Worker receives the response from RabbitMQ.
