== Leader Component

**Discord Communication**: The Leader uses `discord4j.core.GatewayDiscordClient` to interact with Discord, including receiving events and sending messages.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== Worker Component

**Discord Communication**: The Worker interacts with Discord through the Connect-middleware.

**Clash Royale API**: The Worker fetches data from the Clash Royale API to respond to user queries.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== Connect-middleware Component

**RSocket Communication**: The Connect-middleware uses RSocket for reactive communication, enabling efficient and scalable interactions between components.

**Redis**: Used for caching data to improve performance.

**RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

== RSocket Integration in cr-discord-bot

The `cr-discord-bot` project utilizes RSocket for efficient, reactive communication between its components. This document outlines the role of RSocket within the `connect-middleware`, `leader`, and `worker` subprojects.

==== Connect-Middleware

The `connect-middleware` serves as an intermediary, facilitating communication between `worker` components and Discord. It establishes an RSocket server to manage incoming connections from `worker` instances.

==== Leader

The `leader` component orchestrates high-level operations and coordinates interactions with Discord and other components. While its primary communication with Discord is through `discord4j.core.GatewayDiscordClient`, it also establishes RSocket connections for inter-component communication.

==== Worker

The `worker` components handle tasks such as processing Discord commands and retrieving data from external APIs. They connect to the `connect-middleware` via RSocket to send and receive messages, enabling a reactive communication channel.

=== Communication Flow

1. **Initialization**: The `connect-middleware` starts an RSocket server to listen for connections.
2. **Connection Establishment**: `Leader` and `worker` components establish RSocket connections to the `connect-middleware`.
3. **Message Handling**: Depending on the implementation, `leader` and `worker` instances exchange messages through the established RSocket connections.

=== Conclusion

Integrating RSocket within the `cr-discord-bot` project enhances reactive and efficient communication between components, improving the scalability and responsiveness of interactions among the `connect-middleware`, `leader`, and `worker` subprojects.

== Examples

=== Example 1: Worker Fetching Data from Clash Royale API

1. User sends a command to Discord.
2. Worker receives the command via Connect-middleware.
3. Worker fetches data from the Clash Royale API.
4. Worker sends the response back to Discord via Connect-middleware.

=== Example 2: Asynchronous Communication with RabbitMQ

1. Worker sends a message to RabbitMQ.
2. Leader receives the message from RabbitMQ.
3. Leader processes the message and sends a response back to RabbitMQ.
4. Worker receives the response from RabbitMQ.
