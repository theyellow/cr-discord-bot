= Deployment Guide

== Overview

The bot is designed to be highly scalable, with multiple Workers and potentially multiple Leaders. It uses Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.

== Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Docker images for each component
- kubectl configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster

== Building Docker Images with GitHub Workflows

The Docker images for each component are built using GitHub workflows. The workflow configuration can be found in the repository under `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yaml`.

To trigger the workflow and build the Docker images, push your changes to the repository. The workflow will automatically build and push the Docker images to your GitHub Docker repository.

== Steps

1. **Build Docker Images**

The Docker images are built using GitHub workflows. Ensure your changes are pushed to the repository to trigger the build process.

2. **Push Docker Images to Repository**

The GitHub workflow will automatically push the Docker images to your GitHub Docker repository.

3. **Deploy Components to Kubernetes**

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/redis-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/rabbitmq-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/connect-middleware-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/leader-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/worker-deployment.yaml```

== Example Deployment Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: worker-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: worker
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: your-docker-repo/worker:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080```


== Monitoring and Scaling

- Scaling: Use kubectl scale to adjust the number of replicas.
- Monitoring: Use Kubernetes dashboard or Prometheus for monitoring.
```bash
kubectl scale deployment worker-deployment --replicas=5```
