= CR Discord Bot Documentation

== Architecture Overview

The CR Discord Bot is designed as a distributed system using the Discord4J `connect` library to facilitate communication between multiple components. The architecture follows a *Leader-Worker pattern*, with all communication managed via the *Connect-Middleware*. 
For details of architecture see: link:architecture.adoc


=== Components

- *Leader*
  - *Role:*  
    - Coordinates tasks between Discord users and Workers.
    - Assigns tasks to available Workers via the *Connect-Middleware*.
    - *Does not* communicate directly with Discord or the Clash Royale API.
  - *Implementation:*  
    - Connects *only to the Connect-Middleware* via RSocket and HTTP/REST.

- *Worker*
  - *Role:*  
    - Listens for task assignments from the Leader via the *Connect-Middleware*.
    - *Initiates all communication* with *Discord and the Clash Royale API*.
    - Fetches data from the Clash Royale API and returns results.
  - *Implementation:*  
    - Connects to the Connect-Middleware for task reception.
    - Makes HTTP/REST calls to *Discord* (sending responses) and *Clash Royale API* (fetching data).

- *Connect-Middleware*
  - *Role:*  
    - Manages task orchestration between Leaders and Workers.
    - Routes user requests from Discord to the appropriate Leader/Worker.
  - *Implementation:*  
    - Uses the *Discord4J `connect` library* to interact with Discord.
    - Facilitates Leader-Worker communication via *RSocket and HTTP/REST*.

- *Redis*
  - *Role:* 
    - Used for caching and storing temporary data.

- *RabbitMQ*
  - *Role:* 
    - Used for asynchronous communication between components. Acts as a message broker.

- *External APIs*
  - *Clash Royale API*
    - *Role:* 
      - Provide game-related data.
  - *Discord*
    - *Role:* 
      - User interface for interacting with this bot

=== Interaction Flow

1. *Discord Interaction:*  
   - A Discord user sends a command (`"/command"` or `"@crBot ..."`).
   - The request *enters the system via the Connect-Middleware*.
   - The Connect-Middleware sends it to an available Leader.

2. *Task Delegation:*  
   - The Leader *does not process the request itself*.
   - Instead, it assigns the task to a Worker via the Connect-Middleware.

3. *Task Execution:*  
   - The Worker queries the *Clash Royale API* via HTTP/REST.
   - The Worker prepares a response for Discord.

4. *Result Communication:*  
   - The Worker *directly communicates with Discord* via the Connect-Middleware, sending the response back to the user.

For details of communication, see link:communication.adoc

=== Scalability Considerations

- Currently, the system supports *one Leader and multiple Workers*.
- The architecture allows for *multiple Leaders*, but this is *not yet implemented*.

== Deployment Guide

=== Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` configured for the target cluster.
- Docker images for Leader, Worker, and Connect-Middleware stored in a container registry.

=== Deployment Steps

Deployment files can be found at:  
https://github.com/theyellow/cr-discord-bot/tree/main/kubernetes

For more details, see link:kubernetes/deployment.adoc , this is a short version.

1. *Create Namespace:*
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace cr-discord-bot
----

2. *Deploy Connect-Middleware:*
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/connect-middleware-deployment.yaml -n cr-discord-bot
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/connect-middleware-service.yaml -n cr-discord-bot
----

3. *Deploy Leader:*
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/leader-deployment.yaml -n cr-discord-bot
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/leader-service.yaml -n cr-discord-bot
----

4. *Deploy Worker:*
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/worker-deployment.yaml -n cr-discord-bot
----

=== Configuration Management

- Secrets (e.g., Discord token, Clash Royale API key) are stored in *Kubernetes Secrets*.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic cr-discord-bot-secrets \
  --from-literal=discordToken=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN \
  --from-literal=clashRoyaleApiKey=YOUR_CLASH_ROYALE_API_KEY \
  -n cr-discord-bot
----

These secrets are referenced in deployment files:

[source,yaml]
----
env:
  - name: DISCORD_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: cr-discord-bot-secrets
        key: discordToken
  - name: CLASH_ROYALE_API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: cr-discord-bot-secrets
        key: clashRoyaleApiKey
----

=== Logging

- *Only local Logback logging* is configured.
- *No centralized logging* (e.g., Grafana, ELK Stack).

=== CI/CD Workflows

The project uses GitHub workflows for CI/CD. The workflows are located in the `.github/workflows` directory of the repository. Key workflows include:

- **docker-publish.yaml**: Builds and pushes Docker images to the Docker repository.
- **dependency-review.yaml**: Reviews dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
- **maven.yml**: Runs Maven build and tests.
- **codeql-analysis.yml**: Performs CodeQL analysis for code quality and security.
- **sonarcloud_io.yaml**: Integrates with SonarCloud for code quality analysis.
- **docker-image.yaml**: Builds Docker images for specific components.
- **codacy.yaml**: Integrates with Codacy for code quality and coverage analysis.

== Communication Protocols

=== Communication Details

- *Leader ↔ Connect-Middleware*  
  - *Protocol:* RSocket (with HTTP/REST as needed).  
  - *Purpose:* Task delegation and receiving results.

- *Worker ↔ Connect-Middleware*  
  - *Protocols:* RSocket and HTTP/REST.  
  - *Purpose:* Task reception and result transmission.

- *Worker → External APIs (Clash Royale API)*  
  - *Protocol:* HTTP/REST.  
  - *Purpose:* Fetching data.

- *Worker → Discord (via Connect-Middleware)*  
  - *Protocol:* RSocket and HTTP/REST.  
  - *Purpose:* Sending results back to users.

=== Example Data Payloads

*Task Assignment (Leader to Worker via Connect-Middleware)*

[source,json]
----
{
  "taskId": "12345",
  "action": "fetchPlayerStats",
  "parameters": {
    "playerTag": "#ABC123"
  }
}
----

*Task Result (Worker to Discord via Connect-Middleware)*

[source,json]
----
{
  "taskId": "12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "playerName": "JohnDoe",
    "trophies": 4500
  }
}
----

=== Security Considerations

- *No security measures are currently implemented.*
- *Future possibilities:* Authentication, encryption, rate limiting.
