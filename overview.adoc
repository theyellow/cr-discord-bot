= Overall Overview

The bot is an experimental project designed to explore CI/CD, Kubernetes, and various frameworks like Spring Boot and Micronaut. It is highly scalable, with multiple Workers and potentially multiple Leaders, and uses Redis and RabbitMQ for caching and asynchronous communication.

== Main Components

1. **Leader**
   - Manages high-level orchestration and coordination.
   - Communicates with Discord using `discord4j.core.GatewayDiscordClient`.

2. **Worker**
   - Handles tasks such as receiving commands from Discord and fetching data from the Clash Royale API.
   - Communicates with Discord via the Connect-middleware.

3. **Connect-middleware**
   - Acts as a bridge between the Worker and Discord.
   - Uses RSocket for reactive communication.

== Communication

- **Discord Communication**: Handled by the Leader and Worker via the Connect-middleware.
- **Clash Royale API**: Accessed by the Worker to fetch data.
- **RSocket**: Used by the Connect-middleware for reactive communication.

== Deployment

- Deployed using Kubernetes for scalability.
- Each component is deployed as a Kubernetes pod.
- Example deployment configuration provided in the deployment documentation.

== CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment)

The project uses GitHub workflows for CI/CD. 

- Automated workflows:
  - Java Build
  - Docker image builds
  - Docker image registry push 
  - Dependency review
  - Static code analysis (SonarCloud, CodeQL, Codacy)
- *Automated tests are not yet implemented.*
