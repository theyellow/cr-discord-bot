= Architecture Overview

== Main Components

1. **Leader**
   - **Role**: Manages high-level orchestration and coordination.
   - **Key Classes**:
     - `ClashRoyalDiscordLeader.java`: Initializes the `GatewayDiscordClient` and manages communication with Discord.
   - **Communication**:
     - **Discord**: Uses `discord4j.core.GatewayDiscordClient` to interact with Discord.
     - **Redis**: Caches data to improve performance.
     - **RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

2. **Worker**
   - **Role**: Handles tasks such as receiving slash commands and @-mentions from Discord, fetching information from the Clash Royale API, and responding to users.
   - **Key Classes**:
     - `WorkerMain.java`: Handles initialization and main logic for processing tasks.
     - `TaskHandler.java`: Manages specific tasks received from Discord.
     - `ClashRoyaleApiClient.java`: Fetches information from the Clash Royale API.
   - **Communication**:
     - **Discord**: Interacts with Discord through the Connect-middleware.
     - **Clash Royale API**: Fetches data to respond to user queries.
     - **Redis**: Caches data to improve performance.
     - **RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

3. **Connect-middleware**
   - **Role**: Acts as a bridge between the Worker and Discord, facilitating communication.
   - **Key Classes**:
     - `ConnectMiddleware.java`: Handles initialization and main logic for facilitating communication.
   - **Communication**:
     - **RSocket**: Uses RSocket for reactive communication.
     - **Redis**: Caches data to improve performance.
     - **RabbitMQ**: Facilitates asynchronous communication with other components.

4. **Redis**
   - **Role**: Used for caching and storing temporary data to improve performance and handle rate limits.
   - **Communication**: Interacts with all components to cache data and manage state.

5. **RabbitMQ**
   - **Role**: Acts as a message broker to facilitate asynchronous communication between components.
   - **Communication**: Used by all components to send and receive messages, ensuring reliable and scalable communication.
